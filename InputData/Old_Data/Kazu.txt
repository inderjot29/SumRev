I visited here already twice, thanks to everybody in Montreal just LOVING this place. They can't stop talking about it! The burgers were alright. Very very tasty but I wouldn't line up for this one. I would line up for the ramen and the 48-hour pork rice!!!! Both of these are incredibly delicious.Staff is forever friendly, even with the rush and jam-packed space that is Kazu. A great place to be!!! I sat at the bar both times I was here, and the kitchen staff are full of smiles and kindness. Kazu deserves my 5 star!F-bomb phenomenal.Get there when the door opens or risk waiting for a bit. But just know this is a line most would gladly stand in for an hour.Menu is alike what we ate in Japan. Seriously. I've only been able to say this once before.It's a busy spot. If your entire party isn't there, they move on to the next. SORRY NOT SORRY.The salmon Tuna bowl is so light and delicious. there is just the right amount of rice and topped with the salmon and tuna makes it so easy to eat. with lettuce, sweet onions and their crispy nest of crispiness (its like strings of the shrimp chips). I would be able to eat this all the time because its so light and flavourful. The sauces in this dish is tangy and solid, just very good. Ramen: The original Ramen satisfies any ramen craving. The noodles feel like their homemade and the broth is very flavourful. It's thick and comforting. The only critique is I wish they were able to strain the soup making it silky and even better. Because now, the broth is sligh grainy from all the stuff they put in it and the meat and noodles and what not. They also have a curry ramen. Its similar to the original but the brother is different, its heavier and thicker. Too man flavours in your mouth after, making it not as pleasing at the original.Both the eggplant dip and porkcheek dip are delicious! texture is so perfect, not gamey or weird at all. Its served with drizzles of diff sauces on the side and their crispy rice puffs. so every bit you taste the dip but you also get the crunch. Very good appetizer. The beef plate is so good! its literaly just rice, salade and ribs or wtv meat. The meat is literally just so flavourful, its juicy and so tender. When you bite it, it rips off the bone so easily and its still so saucy till the moment you put it in your mouth. Shrimp burger is okay, its not one of the best dishes. I think its lacking in seasoning with the patty itself and the bread to patty ratio is off. The shrimp patty is too large but too thin for the bread.The octopus plate was like a burst of flavours. It just melted in your mouth, it was not chewy at all. Easy to eat and just grilled so perfectly.I wanted to order the tuna belly but they sold out. that happens often. The salmon belly is so tender, feels like butter in your mouth. Literally took a bite and i didnt have to chew. I just closed my mouth and the salmon just melted in my mouth on my tongue. Grilled perfected with a great marinade.Overall, Kazu is very good. It's simple food done right. The sauces are so flavourful, the pairing with salads keeps its light and delicious. I would recommend Kazu to everyone and it is definitely worth the wait no matter how long the line!Absolutely, without a doubt, the best Japanese food I've ever had the honor of eating. It is truly a blessing to have been able to eat here twice. My boyfriend and I visited Montreal for four days and two of them were spent at Kazu. On one of the days, my poor, cold, boyfriend had a craving for ramen. Thanks to his craving and Yelp, we were able to find Kazu! When we got there, there was a line to get inside. It was so cold but we stuck it out and made it in! This place is small. There's maybe 6 counter seats and 5 tables inside that can seat 2-4 people each.We had the ramen (which btw is the absolute BEST ramen I've ever had) and the beef rib bowl the first day we went and the second day we had the ramen and tuna/salmon salad. The second day we went we were driving five hours back home. We lamented not having any accessibility to Kazu anymore so we ordered a beef rib bowl to go. They gave us two huge ribs! It was awesome! I don't know how to describe the amazing flavor in all their dishes. Their food puts me at a loss for words. At best, all I can say is it is amazing and savory and delicious. Their food tastes like edible love. My boyfriend and I still talk about how amazing Kazu is and if it's feasible to drive five hours and cross the US/Canada border just to eat there. Seriously, it's that good.If you are blessed enough to live in Montreal and haven't tried Kazu yet, go! You are SO lucky! I envy you! And if you're in Montreal visiting and trying to decide where's a good place to eat, I've decided for you, it's Kazu! GO!Opens at 12 for lunch so try to arrive 15mins early to make sure to have a seat.Tiny little japanesse restaurant with super good good. Had the tuna and salmon rice bowl and it was delicious.The restaurant is very small and tables are really close to each other...you are seated extremely closely to your neighbor table....If you mind that then it's not the place for you. If you are into great food and friendly service than make sure to check it out.Okay, let me start off by saying I hyped this place way too much in my head. I read the reviews, I waited the hour in line, I anticipated coming here for about a year... I was expecting, like, the holy grail of Japanese food. Beyond that, even. I was expecting to taste flavours that don't even exist yet. And I was a little disappointed, but only because I had built Kazu up to an unattainable standard. I tried the shrimp burger and the 48 hour beef bowl; both were really, really good. I liked the shrimp burger a little more (believe the hype on this one, guys), but the 48 hour beef was really delicious. Super flavourful and fresh. And service was great, too. Quick and efficient, despite the small space. Overall I'd say this place is worth the wait - although the food didn't blow me away, it's still among the best Japanese I've had in the city so far. Plus I found their options to be super unique. I'm definitely going to brave the lineup again; there are so many other things I'm dying to try!Great Japanese food. Make sure you go a bit earlier as there's always a queue. We waited for 15-20 minutes on the latest visit but you could see the turn around time inside the restaurant was quick and the service was ON it with the many staff working there. We ordered the aubergine starter, chicken gyozas, pork kebabs and tofu kimchi salad, which were all delicious. When we finished these, we were promptly served our main courses - a Korean pork bulgogi-like dish called Buta-Don, a bibimbap with the massive beef rib and a Vegetable Bowl. All were great and well made, well balanced dishes.I would call this Japanese fusion. No sushi is served here. Service was quick. Not the place to go for a long chatty meal.Everything you've heard is true. We came here twice in four days because we couldn't get this food out of our MINDS. Cons: The wait and squished eating experience.Pros: THE. FOOD. Just order everything.Not my first visit, but it had been a while (2011 as I backtrack my pictures!).We basically ordered whatever the waitress suggested.Conclusion? The food was divine, well thought-out with intricate flavours and textures. However sauces do repeat themselves and you fell pressured to order fast and to eat fast; all to ensure their tremendous turnover. Food is a 8.5/10 but the experience as a whole would be more a 7/10 (i.e.: good place for a quick bite on a day you don't want to cook, bad choice for a 'wine and dine' kinda night).This was my first meal in Montréal and I was glad I came here. My friend and I came here after wandering down the street. Because there was a line, we thought that this is definitely a place to go! After waiting for a while, we were seated by the bar so we got to see chefs making every order. Since we didn't eat anything since the night before, we ordered a lot of food. We got mackerel, okonomiyaki, grilled squid, and a chicken burger. We were very happy with the dishes. The mackerel tasted a bit fishy though. Anywho, I'd definitely come back here agin when I'm craving Japanese food and when I'm in the area.This place is part of my top 5 places to go in Montreal! (Visit my page to read my other top 5 reviews!)Kazu has it all - Creativity, taste and atmosphere. I love coming here since they have daily specials that are always surprisingly good. I usually get the Tuna Salmon Bowl, which is absolutely delicious. The texture of the salad mixed with the soft sushi rice and fresh tuna is just perfection at its finest. The portions are quite generous, so be careful of how much you order! Their earl grey ice cream is just a taste of heaven. This is one of the places I miss the most!Trust me when I say this is the place to go for all you 'food instagrammers'. The presentation is out of this world and some of the finest I have seen. What is amazing is that the taste is just as good! Very highly recommended and must go place if you are ever in Montreal.Warning there may be a long lineup, but definitely worth it!Everytime I go by Kazu, I always see a long line up that starts within the restaurant and all the way outside. The line up is there for a good reason. Everything on their menu is so great that it is definitely worth waiting! Although the restaurant is very small, all the servers are quick, very friendly, and organized. I'm surprised at how organized the entire restaurant is despite being a very small restaurant! The food is incredible, classic authentic Japanese & Asian cuisines are available with a fusion twist that fits almost everyone's tastebuds. If you sit at the bar, you're able to see all the chefs at work at their open kitchen which is incredibly cool. I always want to go back to Kazu but I'm not a fan of waiting in line.This is probably one of the few places in Montreal that serves decent Japanese food. While the food and ambiance is good, the wait time and pricing for the food...not so great! Waiting could take up to at least 45 minutes if you are planning to dine in the afternoon. The food here is pretty overpriced considering that each meal is at least $10-17. I would only go here on a special occasion and indulge in lovely Japanese food.Hole in the wall type Japanese BBQ joint, this place is legit. The wait is well worth it. Start with the chicken tortilla then go for the dumplings. The shrimp burger is also delicious. Kazu, the man in the yellow t-shirt does it right.I was actually excited to try this place out as I've seen the kind of monstrous lineup this place can have. Kazu is really small and the tables are tight. The staff were really friendly and you can occasionally hear them yell "thank you" to customers in Japanese, which is quite amusing. Because there was so much hype I was expecting amazing mouth watering food. Unfortunately for me, most dishes were just about mediocre. My appetizer consisted of pork cheek paste served with tortillas. It was okay but I think it would make a better snack than an appetizer and the presentation was a bit messy. I had beef galbi as my main which is korean BBQ short ribs which was served with plain white rice and salad on top. The beef itself was good and well marinated but the salad was really subpar. The salad was cut into strips and appeared boring to me. Also, the dressing was minimal and nothing special. My friend had the ramen and he told me that it wasn't mind-blowing neither. My favorite dish throughout the course was probably the homemade ice cream with wasabi sauce. The waitress told me that they make their own wasabi and it shows. This green Japanese mustard was smooth and it goes surprisingly well with their homemade vanilla ice cream. I didn't get too much of that kick in the nose that you get from commercial wasabi and the flavors were fresh and fragrant. But overall, Kazu to me was just an ordinary visit. I don't know why there's so much hype about this place. Maybe I have to give Kazu another try during diner to change my mind. I will update this review upon my next visit.Delicious. Nothing was bad. Extremely long line up as they don't take reservations. We were a group of 5 and got there at 6 on a really cold day, we had to wait about 15 minutes. Keep in mind they only serve ramen at lunch if you wanted to try it. We tried the beef rib, grilled octopus, shrimp burger, gyoza,  beeef meatball, 48 hour pork, tuna tartar.I cannot say enough about this place. It is my favorite restaurant in Montreal.Food is great - I recommend the Tuna Salmon Bowl and my boyfriend loves the Salmon Burger. Service is impeccable - the waitstaff are friendly, funny, and fast. I enjoy sitting at the bar and ordering a bottle of sake while watching the food be prepared. I understand that some people may complain about the wait on a Friday or Saturday night (the restaurant is very small), but that is definitely part of the charm. The space itself is quaint, intimate, and charming. Great for a casual date, dining alone, or bringing a friend or two.The salad with raw tuna corn and the crispy noodles is so damn good. Love the staff and everything about this gemNot the traditional Japanese food that you've found every corner. It is well marinated and made. THE salmon and tuna bowl and beef dish are all very fresh and flavorful. And the mackerel was great too! Not a big fan of the ice-cream.When in Montreal, you have to add this place on your must-eat destination. I didn't expect to eat at a Japanese restaurant while in Montreal but all the locals rave about it. I came in Kazu for lunch expecting ramen and sushi on the menu. Yeah, they have that but I wanted to try izakaya dishes for the first time. Yes this place comes with a line like all other popular Montrealian restaurants. I have to admit, the space is tiny, tight and overcrowded. The staff is super friendly and unusually cheerful. The menu is one big mess -handwritten with Post-Its add-ons. The food presentation may look disgusting but the taste was out of this world. I had carpaccio de boeuf which was raw filet in a vinegar base sauce over spring mix salad. It's very tasty and a good starter. I also had the eggplant dip. Yes, the presentation is messy looking but it works for this place. As I look around the restaurant, the sheets of paper covering the entire wall described a more adventurous menu that was not reflected on the so-so lunch menu. If you want a daring and adventurous experience, try coming here for dinner. Order from the wall.I visited here already twice, thanks to everybody in Montreal just LOVING this place.

And if you're in Montreal visiting and trying to decide where's a good place to eat, I've decided for you, it's Kazu! GO!Opens at 12 for lunch so try to arrive 15mins early to make sure to have a seat.Tiny little japanesse restaurant with super good good. Had the tuna and salmon rice bowl and it was delicious.The restaurant is very small and tables are really close to each other...you are seated extremely closely to your neighbor table....If you mind that then it's not the place for you. If you are into great food and friendly service than make sure to check it out.Okay, let me start off by saying I hyped this place way too much in my head. I read the reviews, I waited the hour in line, I anticipated coming here for about a year... I was expecting, like, the holy grail of Japanese food. Beyond that, even. I was expecting to taste flavours that don't even exist yet. And I was a little disappointed, but only because I had built Kazu up to an unattainable standard. I tried the shrimp burger and the 48 hour beef bowl; both were really, really good. I liked the shrimp burger a little more (believe the hype on this one, guys), but the 48 hour beef was really delicious. Super flavourful and fresh. And service was great, too. Quick and efficient, despite the small space. Overall I'd say this place is worth the wait - although the food didn't blow me away, it's still among the best Japanese I've had in the city so far. Plus I found their options to be super unique. I'm definitely going to brave the lineup again; there are so many other things I'm dying to try!Great Japanese food. Make sure you go a bit earlier as there's always a queue. We waited for 15-20 minutes on the latest visit but you could see the turn around time inside the restaurant was quick and the service was ON it with the many staff working there. We ordered the aubergine starter, chicken gyozas, pork kebabs and tofu kimchi salad, which were all delicious. When we finished these, we were promptly served our main courses - a Korean pork bulgogi-like dish called Buta-Don, a bibimbap with the massive beef rib and a Vegetable Bowl. All were great and well made, well balanced dishes.I would call this Japanese fusion. No sushi is served here. Service was quick. Not the place to go for a long chatty meal.Everything you've heard is true. We came here twice in four days because we couldn't get this food out of our MINDS. Cons: The wait and squished eating experience.Pros: THE. FOOD. Just order everything.Not my first visit, but it had been a while (2011 as I backtrack my pictures!).We basically ordered whatever the waitress suggested.Conclusion? The food was divine, well thought-out with intricate flavours and textures. However sauces do repeat themselves and you fell pressured to order fast and to eat fast; all to ensure their tremendous turnover. Food is a 8.5/10 but the experience as a whole would be more a 7/10 (i.e.: good place for a quick bite on a day you don't want to cook, bad choice for a 'wine and dine' kinda night).This was my first meal in Montréal and I was glad I came here. My friend and I came here after wandering down the street. Because there was a line, we thought that this is definitely a place to go! After waiting for a while, we were seated by the bar so we got to see chefs making every order. Since we didn't eat anything since the night before, we ordered a lot of food. We got mackerel, okonomiyaki, grilled squid, and a chicken burger. We were very happy with the dishes. The mackerel tasted a bit fishy though. Anywho, I'd definitely come back here agin when I'm craving Japanese food and when I'm in the area.This place is part of my top 5 places to go in Montreal! (Visit my page to read my other top 5 reviews!)Kazu has it all - Creativity, taste and atmosphere. I love coming here since they have daily specials that are always surprisingly good. I usually get the Tuna Salmon Bowl, which is absolutely delicious. The texture of the salad mixed with the soft sushi rice and fresh tuna is just perfection at its finest. The portions are quite generous, so be careful of how much you order! Their earl grey ice cream is just a taste of heaven. This is one of the places I miss the most!Trust me when I say this is the place to go for all you 'food instagrammers'. The presentation is out of this world and some of the finest I have seen. What is amazing is that the taste is just as good! Very highly recommended and must go place if you are ever in Montreal.Warning there may be a long lineup, but definitely worth it!Everytime I go by Kazu, I always see a long line up that starts within the restaurant and all the way outside. The line up is there for a good reason. Everything on their menu is so great that it is definitely worth waiting! Although the restaurant is very small, all the servers are quick, very friendly, and organized. I'm surprised at how organized the entire restaurant is despite being a very small restaurant! The food is incredible, classic authentic Japanese & Asian cuisines are available with a fusion twist that fits almost everyone's tastebuds. If you sit at the bar, you're able to see all the chefs at work at their open kitchen which is incredibly cool. I always want to go back to Kazu but I'm not a fan of waiting in line.This is probably one of the few places in Montreal that serves decent Japanese food. While the food and ambiance is good, the wait time and pricing for the food...not so great! Waiting could take up to at least 45 minutes if you are planning to dine in the afternoon. The food here is pretty overpriced considering that each meal is at least $10-17. I would only go here on a special occasion and indulge in lovely Japanese food.Hole in the wall type Japanese BBQ joint, this place is legit. The wait is well worth it. Start with the chicken tortilla then go for the dumplings. The shrimp burger is also delicious. Kazu, the man in the yellow t-shirt does it right.I was actually excited to try this place out as I've seen the kind of monstrous lineup this place can have. Kazu is really small and the tables are tight. The staff were really friendly and you can occasionally hear them yell "thank you" to customers in Japanese, which is quite amusing. Because there was so much hype I was expecting amazing mouth watering food. Unfortunately for me, most dishes were just about mediocre. My appetizer consisted of pork cheek paste served with tortillas. It was okay but I think it would make a better snack than an appetizer and the presentation was a bit messy. I had beef galbi as my main which is korean BBQ short ribs which was served with plain white rice and salad on top. The beef itself was good and well marinated but the salad was really subpar. The salad was cut into strips and appeared boring to me. Also, the dressing was minimal and nothing special. My friend had the ramen and he told me that it wasn't mind-blowing neither. My favorite dish throughout the course was probably the homemade ice cream with wasabi sauce. The waitress told me that they make their own wasabi and it shows. This green Japanese mustard was smooth and it goes surprisingly well with their homemade vanilla ice cream. I didn't get too much of that kick in the nose that you get from commercial wasabi and the flavors were fresh and fragrant. But overall, Kazu to me was just an ordinary visit. I don't know why there's so much hype about this place. Maybe I have to give Kazu another try during diner to change my mind. I will update this review upon my next visit.Delicious. Nothing was bad. Extremely long line up as they don't take reservations. We were a group of 5 and got there at 6 on a really cold day, we had to wait about 15 minutes. Keep in mind they only serve ramen at lunch if you wanted to try it. We tried the beef rib, grilled octopus, shrimp burger, gyoza,  beeef meatball, 48 hour pork, tuna tartar.I cannot say enough about this place. It is my favorite restaurant in Montreal.Food is great - I recommend the Tuna Salmon Bowl and my boyfriend loves the Salmon Burger. Service is impeccable - the waitstaff are friendly, funny, and fast. I enjoy sitting at the bar and ordering a bottle of sake while watching the food be prepared. I understand that some people may complain about the wait on a Friday or Saturday night (the restaurant is very small), but that is definitely part of the charm. The space itself is quaint, intimate, and charming. Great for a casual date, dining alone, or bringing a friend or two.The salad with raw tuna corn and the crispy noodles is so damn good. Love the staff and everything about this gemNot the traditional Japanese food that you've found every corner. It is well marinated and made. THE salmon and tuna bowl and beef dish are all very fresh and flavorful. And the mackerel was great too! Not a big fan of the ice-cream.When in Montreal, you have to add this place on your must-eat destination. I didn't expect to eat at a Japanese restaurant while in Montreal but all the locals rave about it. I came in Kazu for lunch expecting ramen and sushi on the menu. Yeah, they have that but I wanted to try izakaya dishes for the first time. Yes this place comes with a line like all other popular Montrealian restaurants. I have to admit, the space is tiny, tight and overcrowded. The staff is super friendly and unusually cheerful. The menu is one big mess -handwritten with Post-Its add-ons. The food presentation may look disgusting but the taste was out of this world. I had carpaccio de boeuf which was raw filet in a vinegar base sauce over spring mix salad. It's very tasty and a good starter. I also had the eggplant dip. Yes, the presentation is messy looking but it works for this place. As I look around the restaurant, the sheets of paper covering the entire wall described a more adventurous menu that was not reflected on the so-so lunch menu. If you want a daring and adventurous experience, try coming here for dinner. Order from the wall.I visited here already twice, thanks to everybody in Montreal just LOVING this place. They can't stop talking about it! The burgers were alright. Very very tasty but I wouldn't line up for this one. I would line up for the ramen and the 48-hour pork rice!!!! Both of these are incredibly delicious.Staff is forever friendly, even with the rush and jam-packed space that is Kazu. A great place to be!!! I sat at the bar both times I was here, and the kitchen staff are full of smiles and kindness. Kazu deserves my 5 star!F-bomb phenomenal.Get there when the door opens or risk waiting for a bit. But just know this is a line most would gladly stand in for an hour.Menu is alike what we ate in Japan. Seriously. I've only been able to say this once before.It's a busy spot. If your entire party isn't there, they move on to the next. SORRY NOT SORRY.The salmon Tuna bowl is so light and delicious. there is just the right amount of rice and topped with the salmon and tuna makes it so easy to eat. with lettuce, sweet onions and their crispy nest of crispiness (its like strings of the shrimp chips). I would be able to eat this all the time because its so light and flavourful. The sauces in this dish is tangy and solid, just very good. Ramen: The original Ramen satisfies any ramen craving. The noodles feel like their homemade and the broth is very flavourful. It's thick and comforting. The only critique is I wish they were able to strain the soup making it silky and even better. Because now, the broth is sligh grainy from all the stuff they put in it and the meat and noodles and what not. They also have a curry ramen. Its similar to the original but the brother is different, its heavier and thicker. Too man flavours in your mouth after, making it not as pleasing at the original.Both the eggplant dip and porkcheek dip are delicious! texture is so perfect, not gamey or weird at all. Its served with drizzles of diff sauces on the side and their crispy rice puffs. so every bit you taste the dip but you also get the crunch. Very good appetizer. The beef plate is so good! its literaly just rice, salade and ribs or wtv meat. The meat is literally just so flavourful, its juicy and so tender. When you bite it, it rips off the bone so easily and its still so saucy till the moment you put it in your mouth. Shrimp burger is okay, its not one of the best dishes. I think its lacking in seasoning with the patty itself and the bread to patty ratio is off. The shrimp patty is too large but too thin for the bread.The octopus plate was like a burst of flavours. It just melted in your mouth, it was not chewy at all. Easy to eat and just grilled so perfectly.I wanted to order the tuna belly but they sold out. that happens often. The salmon belly is so tender, feels like butter in your mouth. Literally took a bite and i didnt have to chew. I just closed my mouth and the salmon just melted in my mouth on my tongue. Grilled perfected with a great marinade.Overall, Kazu is very good. It's simple food done right. The sauces are so flavourful, the pairing with salads keeps its light and delicious. I would recommend Kazu to everyone and it is definitely worth the wait no matter how long the line!Absolutely, without a doubt, the best Japanese food I've ever had the honor of eating. It is truly a blessing to have been able to eat here twice. My boyfriend and I visited Montreal for four days and two of them were spent at Kazu. On one of the days, my poor, cold, boyfriend had a craving for ramen. Thanks to his craving and Yelp, we were able to find Kazu! When we got there, there was a line to get inside. It was so cold but we stuck it out and made it in! This place is small. There's maybe 6 counter seats and 5 tables inside that can seat 2-4 people each.We had the ramen (which btw is the absolute BEST ramen I've ever had) and the beef rib bowl the first day we went and the second day we had the ramen and tuna/salmon salad. The second day we went we were driving five hours back home. We lamented not having any accessibility to Kazu anymore so we ordered a beef rib bowl to go. They gave us two huge ribs! It was awesome! I don't know how to describe the amazing flavor in all their dishes. Their food puts me at a loss for words. At best, all I can say is it is amazing and savory and delicious. Their food tastes like edible love. My boyfriend and I still talk about how amazing Kazu is and if it's feasible to drive five hours and cross the US/Canada border just to eat there. Seriously, it's that good.If you are blessed enough to live in Montreal and haven't tried Kazu yet, go! You are SO lucky! I envy you!

This is one of the places I miss the most!Trust me when I say this is the place to go for all you 'food instagrammers'. The presentation is out of this world and some of the finest I have seen. What is amazing is that the taste is just as good! Very highly recommended and must go place if you are ever in Montreal.Warning there may be a long lineup, but definitely worth it!Everytime I go by Kazu, I always see a long line up that starts within the restaurant and all the way outside. The line up is there for a good reason. Everything on their menu is so great that it is definitely worth waiting! Although the restaurant is very small, all the servers are quick, very friendly, and organized. I'm surprised at how organized the entire restaurant is despite being a very small restaurant! The food is incredible, classic authentic Japanese & Asian cuisines are available with a fusion twist that fits almost everyone's tastebuds. If you sit at the bar, you're able to see all the chefs at work at their open kitchen which is incredibly cool. I always want to go back to Kazu but I'm not a fan of waiting in line.This is probably one of the few places in Montreal that serves decent Japanese food. While the food and ambiance is good, the wait time and pricing for the food...not so great! Waiting could take up to at least 45 minutes if you are planning to dine in the afternoon. The food here is pretty overpriced considering that each meal is at least $10-17. I would only go here on a special occasion and indulge in lovely Japanese food.Hole in the wall type Japanese BBQ joint, this place is legit. The wait is well worth it. Start with the chicken tortilla then go for the dumplings. The shrimp burger is also delicious. Kazu, the man in the yellow t-shirt does it right.I was actually excited to try this place out as I've seen the kind of monstrous lineup this place can have. Kazu is really small and the tables are tight. The staff were really friendly and you can occasionally hear them yell "thank you" to customers in Japanese, which is quite amusing. Because there was so much hype I was expecting amazing mouth watering food. Unfortunately for me, most dishes were just about mediocre. My appetizer consisted of pork cheek paste served with tortillas. It was okay but I think it would make a better snack than an appetizer and the presentation was a bit messy. I had beef galbi as my main which is korean BBQ short ribs which was served with plain white rice and salad on top. The beef itself was good and well marinated but the salad was really subpar. The salad was cut into strips and appeared boring to me. Also, the dressing was minimal and nothing special. My friend had the ramen and he told me that it wasn't mind-blowing neither. My favorite dish throughout the course was probably the homemade ice cream with wasabi sauce. The waitress told me that they make their own wasabi and it shows. This green Japanese mustard was smooth and it goes surprisingly well with their homemade vanilla ice cream. I didn't get too much of that kick in the nose that you get from commercial wasabi and the flavors were fresh and fragrant. But overall, Kazu to me was just an ordinary visit. I don't know why there's so much hype about this place. Maybe I have to give Kazu another try during diner to change my mind. I will update this review upon my next visit.Delicious. Nothing was bad. Extremely long line up as they don't take reservations. We were a group of 5 and got there at 6 on a really cold day, we had to wait about 15 minutes. Keep in mind they only serve ramen at lunch if you wanted to try it. We tried the beef rib, grilled octopus, shrimp burger, gyoza,  beeef meatball, 48 hour pork, tuna tartar.I cannot say enough about this place. It is my favorite restaurant in Montreal.Food is great - I recommend the Tuna Salmon Bowl and my boyfriend loves the Salmon Burger. Service is impeccable - the waitstaff are friendly, funny, and fast. I enjoy sitting at the bar and ordering a bottle of sake while watching the food be prepared. I understand that some people may complain about the wait on a Friday or Saturday night (the restaurant is very small), but that is definitely part of the charm. The space itself is quaint, intimate, and charming. Great for a casual date, dining alone, or bringing a friend or two.The salad with raw tuna corn and the crispy noodles is so damn good. Love the staff and everything about this gemNot the traditional Japanese food that you've found every corner. It is well marinated and made. THE salmon and tuna bowl and beef dish are all very fresh and flavorful. And the mackerel was great too! Not a big fan of the ice-cream.When in Montreal, you have to add this place on your must-eat destination. I didn't expect to eat at a Japanese restaurant while in Montreal but all the locals rave about it. I came in Kazu for lunch expecting ramen and sushi on the menu. Yeah, they have that but I wanted to try izakaya dishes for the first time. Yes this place comes with a line like all other popular Montrealian restaurants. I have to admit, the space is tiny, tight and overcrowded. The staff is super friendly and unusually cheerful. The menu is one big mess -handwritten with Post-Its add-ons. The food presentation may look disgusting but the taste was out of this world. I had carpaccio de boeuf which was raw filet in a vinegar base sauce over spring mix salad. It's very tasty and a good starter. I also had the eggplant dip. Yes, the presentation is messy looking but it works for this place. As I look around the restaurant, the sheets of paper covering the entire wall described a more adventurous menu that was not reflected on the so-so lunch menu. If you want a daring and adventurous experience, try coming here for dinner. Order from the wall.I visited here already twice, thanks to everybody in Montreal just LOVING this place. They can't stop talking about it! The burgers were alright. Very very tasty but I wouldn't line up for this one. I would line up for the ramen and the 48-hour pork rice!!!! Both of these are incredibly delicious.Staff is forever friendly, even with the rush and jam-packed space that is Kazu. A great place to be!!! I sat at the bar both times I was here, and the kitchen staff are full of smiles and kindness. Kazu deserves my 5 star!F-bomb phenomenal.Get there when the door opens or risk waiting for a bit. But just know this is a line most would gladly stand in for an hour.Menu is alike what we ate in Japan. Seriously. I've only been able to say this once before.It's a busy spot. If your entire party isn't there, they move on to the next. SORRY NOT SORRY.The salmon Tuna bowl is so light and delicious. there is just the right amount of rice and topped with the salmon and tuna makes it so easy to eat. with lettuce, sweet onions and their crispy nest of crispiness (its like strings of the shrimp chips). I would be able to eat this all the time because its so light and flavourful. The sauces in this dish is tangy and solid, just very good. Ramen: The original Ramen satisfies any ramen craving. The noodles feel like their homemade and the broth is very flavourful. It's thick and comforting. The only critique is I wish they were able to strain the soup making it silky and even better. Because now, the broth is sligh grainy from all the stuff they put in it and the meat and noodles and what not. They also have a curry ramen. Its similar to the original but the brother is different, its heavier and thicker. Too man flavours in your mouth after, making it not as pleasing at the original.Both the eggplant dip and porkcheek dip are delicious! texture is so perfect, not gamey or weird at all. Its served with drizzles of diff sauces on the side and their crispy rice puffs. so every bit you taste the dip but you also get the crunch. Very good appetizer. The beef plate is so good! its literaly just rice, salade and ribs or wtv meat. The meat is literally just so flavourful, its juicy and so tender. When you bite it, it rips off the bone so easily and its still so saucy till the moment you put it in your mouth. Shrimp burger is okay, its not one of the best dishes. I think its lacking in seasoning with the patty itself and the bread to patty ratio is off. The shrimp patty is too large but too thin for the bread.The octopus plate was like a burst of flavours. It just melted in your mouth, it was not chewy at all. Easy to eat and just grilled so perfectly.I wanted to order the tuna belly but they sold out. that happens often. The salmon belly is so tender, feels like butter in your mouth. Literally took a bite and i didnt have to chew. I just closed my mouth and the salmon just melted in my mouth on my tongue. Grilled perfected with a great marinade.Overall, Kazu is very good. It's simple food done right. The sauces are so flavourful, the pairing with salads keeps its light and delicious. I would recommend Kazu to everyone and it is definitely worth the wait no matter how long the line!Absolutely, without a doubt, the best Japanese food I've ever had the honor of eating. It is truly a blessing to have been able to eat here twice. My boyfriend and I visited Montreal for four days and two of them were spent at Kazu. On one of the days, my poor, cold, boyfriend had a craving for ramen. Thanks to his craving and Yelp, we were able to find Kazu! When we got there, there was a line to get inside. It was so cold but we stuck it out and made it in! This place is small. There's maybe 6 counter seats and 5 tables inside that can seat 2-4 people each.We had the ramen (which btw is the absolute BEST ramen I've ever had) and the beef rib bowl the first day we went and the second day we had the ramen and tuna/salmon salad. The second day we went we were driving five hours back home. We lamented not having any accessibility to Kazu anymore so we ordered a beef rib bowl to go. They gave us two huge ribs! It was awesome! I don't know how to describe the amazing flavor in all their dishes. Their food puts me at a loss for words. At best, all I can say is it is amazing and savory and delicious. Their food tastes like edible love. My boyfriend and I still talk about how amazing Kazu is and if it's feasible to drive five hours and cross the US/Canada border just to eat there. Seriously, it's that good.If you are blessed enough to live in Montreal and haven't tried Kazu yet, go! You are SO lucky! I envy you! And if you're in Montreal visiting and trying to decide where's a good place to eat, I've decided for you, it's Kazu! GO!Opens at 12 for lunch so try to arrive 15mins early to make sure to have a seat.Tiny little japanesse restaurant with super good good. Had the tuna and salmon rice bowl and it was delicious.The restaurant is very small and tables are really close to each other...you are seated extremely closely to your neighbor table....If you mind that then it's not the place for you. If you are into great food and friendly service than make sure to check it out.Okay, let me start off by saying I hyped this place way too much in my head. I read the reviews, I waited the hour in line, I anticipated coming here for about a year... I was expecting, like, the holy grail of Japanese food. Beyond that, even. I was expecting to taste flavours that don't even exist yet. And I was a little disappointed, but only because I had built Kazu up to an unattainable standard. I tried the shrimp burger and the 48 hour beef bowl; both were really, really good. I liked the shrimp burger a little more (believe the hype on this one, guys), but the 48 hour beef was really delicious. Super flavourful and fresh. And service was great, too. Quick and efficient, despite the small space. Overall I'd say this place is worth the wait - although the food didn't blow me away, it's still among the best Japanese I've had in the city so far. Plus I found their options to be super unique. I'm definitely going to brave the lineup again; there are so many other things I'm dying to try!Great Japanese food. Make sure you go a bit earlier as there's always a queue. We waited for 15-20 minutes on the latest visit but you could see the turn around time inside the restaurant was quick and the service was ON it with the many staff working there. We ordered the aubergine starter, chicken gyozas, pork kebabs and tofu kimchi salad, which were all delicious. When we finished these, we were promptly served our main courses - a Korean pork bulgogi-like dish called Buta-Don, a bibimbap with the massive beef rib and a Vegetable Bowl. All were great and well made, well balanced dishes.I would call this Japanese fusion. No sushi is served here. Service was quick. Not the place to go for a long chatty meal.Everything you've heard is true. We came here twice in four days because we couldn't get this food out of our MINDS. Cons: The wait and squished eating experience.Pros: THE. FOOD. Just order everything.Not my first visit, but it had been a while (2011 as I backtrack my pictures!).We basically ordered whatever the waitress suggested.Conclusion? The food was divine, well thought-out with intricate flavours and textures. However sauces do repeat themselves and you fell pressured to order fast and to eat fast; all to ensure their tremendous turnover. Food is a 8.5/10 but the experience as a whole would be more a 7/10 (i.e.: good place for a quick bite on a day you don't want to cook, bad choice for a 'wine and dine' kinda night).This was my first meal in Montréal and I was glad I came here. My friend and I came here after wandering down the street. Because there was a line, we thought that this is definitely a place to go! After waiting for a while, we were seated by the bar so we got to see chefs making every order. Since we didn't eat anything since the night before, we ordered a lot of food. We got mackerel, okonomiyaki, grilled squid, and a chicken burger. We were very happy with the dishes. The mackerel tasted a bit fishy though. Anywho, I'd definitely come back here agin when I'm craving Japanese food and when I'm in the area.This place is part of my top 5 places to go in Montreal! (Visit my page to read my other top 5 reviews!)Kazu has it all - Creativity, taste and atmosphere. I love coming here since they have daily specials that are always surprisingly good. I usually get the Tuna Salmon Bowl, which is absolutely delicious. The texture of the salad mixed with the soft sushi rice and fresh tuna is just perfection at its finest.

THE salmon and tuna bowl and beef dish are all very fresh and flavorful. And the mackerel was great too! Not a big fan of the ice-cream.When in Montreal, you have to add this place on your must-eat destination. I didn't expect to eat at a Japanese restaurant while in Montreal but all the locals rave about it. I came in Kazu for lunch expecting ramen and sushi on the menu. Yeah, they have that but I wanted to try izakaya dishes for the first time. Yes this place comes with a line like all other popular Montrealian restaurants. I have to admit, the space is tiny, tight and overcrowded. The staff is super friendly and unusually cheerful. The menu is one big mess -handwritten with Post-Its add-ons. The food presentation may look disgusting but the taste was out of this world. I had carpaccio de boeuf which was raw filet in a vinegar base sauce over spring mix salad. It's very tasty and a good starter. I also had the eggplant dip. Yes, the presentation is messy looking but it works for this place. As I look around the restaurant, the sheets of paper covering the entire wall described a more adventurous menu that was not reflected on the so-so lunch menu. If you want a daring and adventurous experience, try coming here for dinner. Order from the wall.I visited here already twice, thanks to everybody in Montreal just LOVING this place. They can't stop talking about it! The burgers were alright. Very very tasty but I wouldn't line up for this one. I would line up for the ramen and the 48-hour pork rice!!!! Both of these are incredibly delicious.Staff is forever friendly, even with the rush and jam-packed space that is Kazu. A great place to be!!! I sat at the bar both times I was here, and the kitchen staff are full of smiles and kindness. Kazu deserves my 5 star!F-bomb phenomenal.Get there when the door opens or risk waiting for a bit. But just know this is a line most would gladly stand in for an hour.Menu is alike what we ate in Japan. Seriously. I've only been able to say this once before.It's a busy spot. If your entire party isn't there, they move on to the next. SORRY NOT SORRY.The salmon Tuna bowl is so light and delicious. there is just the right amount of rice and topped with the salmon and tuna makes it so easy to eat. with lettuce, sweet onions and their crispy nest of crispiness (its like strings of the shrimp chips). I would be able to eat this all the time because its so light and flavourful. The sauces in this dish is tangy and solid, just very good. Ramen: The original Ramen satisfies any ramen craving. The noodles feel like their homemade and the broth is very flavourful. It's thick and comforting. The only critique is I wish they were able to strain the soup making it silky and even better. Because now, the broth is sligh grainy from all the stuff they put in it and the meat and noodles and what not. They also have a curry ramen. Its similar to the original but the brother is different, its heavier and thicker. Too man flavours in your mouth after, making it not as pleasing at the original.Both the eggplant dip and porkcheek dip are delicious! texture is so perfect, not gamey or weird at all. Its served with drizzles of diff sauces on the side and their crispy rice puffs. so every bit you taste the dip but you also get the crunch. Very good appetizer. The beef plate is so good! its literaly just rice, salade and ribs or wtv meat. The meat is literally just so flavourful, its juicy and so tender. When you bite it, it rips off the bone so easily and its still so saucy till the moment you put it in your mouth. Shrimp burger is okay, its not one of the best dishes. I think its lacking in seasoning with the patty itself and the bread to patty ratio is off. The shrimp patty is too large but too thin for the bread.The octopus plate was like a burst of flavours. It just melted in your mouth, it was not chewy at all. Easy to eat and just grilled so perfectly.I wanted to order the tuna belly but they sold out. that happens often. The salmon belly is so tender, feels like butter in your mouth. Literally took a bite and i didnt have to chew. I just closed my mouth and the salmon just melted in my mouth on my tongue. Grilled perfected with a great marinade.Overall, Kazu is very good. It's simple food done right. The sauces are so flavourful, the pairing with salads keeps its light and delicious. I would recommend Kazu to everyone and it is definitely worth the wait no matter how long the line!Absolutely, without a doubt, the best Japanese food I've ever had the honor of eating. It is truly a blessing to have been able to eat here twice. My boyfriend and I visited Montreal for four days and two of them were spent at Kazu. On one of the days, my poor, cold, boyfriend had a craving for ramen. Thanks to his craving and Yelp, we were able to find Kazu! When we got there, there was a line to get inside. It was so cold but we stuck it out and made it in! This place is small. There's maybe 6 counter seats and 5 tables inside that can seat 2-4 people each.We had the ramen (which btw is the absolute BEST ramen I've ever had) and the beef rib bowl the first day we went and the second day we had the ramen and tuna/salmon salad. The second day we went we were driving five hours back home. We lamented not having any accessibility to Kazu anymore so we ordered a beef rib bowl to go. They gave us two huge ribs! It was awesome! I don't know how to describe the amazing flavor in all their dishes. Their food puts me at a loss for words. At best, all I can say is it is amazing and savory and delicious. Their food tastes like edible love. My boyfriend and I still talk about how amazing Kazu is and if it's feasible to drive five hours and cross the US/Canada border just to eat there. Seriously, it's that good.If you are blessed enough to live in Montreal and haven't tried Kazu yet, go! You are SO lucky! I envy you! And if you're in Montreal visiting and trying to decide where's a good place to eat, I've decided for you, it's Kazu! GO!Opens at 12 for lunch so try to arrive 15mins early to make sure to have a seat.Tiny little japanesse restaurant with super good good. Had the tuna and salmon rice bowl and it was delicious.The restaurant is very small and tables are really close to each other...you are seated extremely closely to your neighbor table....If you mind that then it's not the place for you. If you are into great food and friendly service than make sure to check it out.Okay, let me start off by saying I hyped this place way too much in my head. I read the reviews, I waited the hour in line, I anticipated coming here for about a year... I was expecting, like, the holy grail of Japanese food. Beyond that, even. I was expecting to taste flavours that don't even exist yet. And I was a little disappointed, but only because I had built Kazu up to an unattainable standard. I tried the shrimp burger and the 48 hour beef bowl; both were really, really good. I liked the shrimp burger a little more (believe the hype on this one, guys), but the 48 hour beef was really delicious. Super flavourful and fresh. And service was great, too. Quick and efficient, despite the small space. Overall I'd say this place is worth the wait - although the food didn't blow me away, it's still among the best Japanese I've had in the city so far. Plus I found their options to be super unique. I'm definitely going to brave the lineup again; there are so many other things I'm dying to try!Great Japanese food. Make sure you go a bit earlier as there's always a queue. We waited for 15-20 minutes on the latest visit but you could see the turn around time inside the restaurant was quick and the service was ON it with the many staff working there. We ordered the aubergine starter, chicken gyozas, pork kebabs and tofu kimchi salad, which were all delicious. When we finished these, we were promptly served our main courses - a Korean pork bulgogi-like dish called Buta-Don, a bibimbap with the massive beef rib and a Vegetable Bowl. All were great and well made, well balanced dishes.I would call this Japanese fusion. No sushi is served here. Service was quick. Not the place to go for a long chatty meal.Everything you've heard is true. We came here twice in four days because we couldn't get this food out of our MINDS. Cons: The wait and squished eating experience.Pros: THE. FOOD. Just order everything.Not my first visit, but it had been a while (2011 as I backtrack my pictures!).We basically ordered whatever the waitress suggested.Conclusion? The food was divine, well thought-out with intricate flavours and textures. However sauces do repeat themselves and you fell pressured to order fast and to eat fast; all to ensure their tremendous turnover. Food is a 8.5/10 but the experience as a whole would be more a 7/10 (i.e.: good place for a quick bite on a day you don't want to cook, bad choice for a 'wine and dine' kinda night).This was my first meal in Montréal and I was glad I came here. My friend and I came here after wandering down the street. Because there was a line, we thought that this is definitely a place to go! After waiting for a while, we were seated by the bar so we got to see chefs making every order. Since we didn't eat anything since the night before, we ordered a lot of food. We got mackerel, okonomiyaki, grilled squid, and a chicken burger. We were very happy with the dishes. The mackerel tasted a bit fishy though. Anywho, I'd definitely come back here agin when I'm craving Japanese food and when I'm in the area.This place is part of my top 5 places to go in Montreal! (Visit my page to read my other top 5 reviews!)Kazu has it all - Creativity, taste and atmosphere. I love coming here since they have daily specials that are always surprisingly good. I usually get the Tuna Salmon Bowl, which is absolutely delicious. The texture of the salad mixed with the soft sushi rice and fresh tuna is just perfection at its finest. The portions are quite generous, so be careful of how much you order! Their earl grey ice cream is just a taste of heaven. This is one of the places I miss the most!Trust me when I say this is the place to go for all you 'food instagrammers'. The presentation is out of this world and some of the finest I have seen. What is amazing is that the taste is just as good! Very highly recommended and must go place if you are ever in Montreal.Warning there may be a long lineup, but definitely worth it!Everytime I go by Kazu, I always see a long line up that starts within the restaurant and all the way outside. The line up is there for a good reason. Everything on their menu is so great that it is definitely worth waiting! Although the restaurant is very small, all the servers are quick, very friendly, and organized. I'm surprised at how organized the entire restaurant is despite being a very small restaurant! The food is incredible, classic authentic Japanese & Asian cuisines are available with a fusion twist that fits almost everyone's tastebuds. If you sit at the bar, you're able to see all the chefs at work at their open kitchen which is incredibly cool. I always want to go back to Kazu but I'm not a fan of waiting in line.This is probably one of the few places in Montreal that serves decent Japanese food. While the food and ambiance is good, the wait time and pricing for the food...not so great! Waiting could take up to at least 45 minutes if you are planning to dine in the afternoon. The food here is pretty overpriced considering that each meal is at least $10-17. I would only go here on a special occasion and indulge in lovely Japanese food.Hole in the wall type Japanese BBQ joint, this place is legit. The wait is well worth it. Start with the chicken tortilla then go for the dumplings. The shrimp burger is also delicious. Kazu, the man in the yellow t-shirt does it right.I was actually excited to try this place out as I've seen the kind of monstrous lineup this place can have. Kazu is really small and the tables are tight. The staff were really friendly and you can occasionally hear them yell "thank you" to customers in Japanese, which is quite amusing. Because there was so much hype I was expecting amazing mouth watering food. Unfortunately for me, most dishes were just about mediocre. My appetizer consisted of pork cheek paste served with tortillas. It was okay but I think it would make a better snack than an appetizer and the presentation was a bit messy. I had beef galbi as my main which is korean BBQ short ribs which was served with plain white rice and salad on top. The beef itself was good and well marinated but the salad was really subpar. The salad was cut into strips and appeared boring to me. Also, the dressing was minimal and nothing special. My friend had the ramen and he told me that it wasn't mind-blowing neither. My favorite dish throughout the course was probably the homemade ice cream with wasabi sauce. The waitress told me that they make their own wasabi and it shows. This green Japanese mustard was smooth and it goes surprisingly well with their homemade vanilla ice cream. I didn't get too much of that kick in the nose that you get from commercial wasabi and the flavors were fresh and fragrant. But overall, Kazu to me was just an ordinary visit. I don't know why there's so much hype about this place. Maybe I have to give Kazu another try during diner to change my mind. I will update this review upon my next visit.Delicious. Nothing was bad. Extremely long line up as they don't take reservations. We were a group of 5 and got there at 6 on a really cold day, we had to wait about 15 minutes. Keep in mind they only serve ramen at lunch if you wanted to try it. We tried the beef rib, grilled octopus, shrimp burger, gyoza,  beeef meatball, 48 hour pork, tuna tartar.I cannot say enough about this place. It is my favorite restaurant in Montreal.Food is great - I recommend the Tuna Salmon Bowl and my boyfriend loves the Salmon Burger. Service is impeccable - the waitstaff are friendly, funny, and fast. I enjoy sitting at the bar and ordering a bottle of sake while watching the food be prepared. I understand that some people may complain about the wait on a Friday or Saturday night (the restaurant is very small), but that is definitely part of the charm. The space itself is quaint, intimate, and charming. Great for a casual date, dining alone, or bringing a friend or two.The salad with raw tuna corn and the crispy noodles is so damn good.

I would recommend Kazu to everyone and it is definitely worth the wait no matter how long the line!Absolutely, without a doubt, the best Japanese food I've ever had the honor of eating. It is truly a blessing to have been able to eat here twice. My boyfriend and I visited Montreal for four days and two of them were spent at Kazu. On one of the days, my poor, cold, boyfriend had a craving for ramen. Thanks to his craving and Yelp, we were able to find Kazu! When we got there, there was a line to get inside. It was so cold but we stuck it out and made it in! This place is small. There's maybe 6 counter seats and 5 tables inside that can seat 2-4 people each.We had the ramen (which btw is the absolute BEST ramen I've ever had) and the beef rib bowl the first day we went and the second day we had the ramen and tuna/salmon salad. The second day we went we were driving five hours back home. We lamented not having any accessibility to Kazu anymore so we ordered a beef rib bowl to go. They gave us two huge ribs! It was awesome! I don't know how to describe the amazing flavor in all their dishes. Their food puts me at a loss for words. At best, all I can say is it is amazing and savory and delicious. Their food tastes like edible love. My boyfriend and I still talk about how amazing Kazu is and if it's feasible to drive five hours and cross the US/Canada border just to eat there. Seriously, it's that good.If you are blessed enough to live in Montreal and haven't tried Kazu yet, go! You are SO lucky! I envy you! And if you're in Montreal visiting and trying to decide where's a good place to eat, I've decided for you, it's Kazu! GO!Opens at 12 for lunch so try to arrive 15mins early to make sure to have a seat.Tiny little japanesse restaurant with super good good. Had the tuna and salmon rice bowl and it was delicious.The restaurant is very small and tables are really close to each other...you are seated extremely closely to your neighbor table....If you mind that then it's not the place for you. If you are into great food and friendly service than make sure to check it out.Okay, let me start off by saying I hyped this place way too much in my head. I read the reviews, I waited the hour in line, I anticipated coming here for about a year... I was expecting, like, the holy grail of Japanese food. Beyond that, even. I was expecting to taste flavours that don't even exist yet. And I was a little disappointed, but only because I had built Kazu up to an unattainable standard. I tried the shrimp burger and the 48 hour beef bowl; both were really, really good. I liked the shrimp burger a little more (believe the hype on this one, guys), but the 48 hour beef was really delicious. Super flavourful and fresh. And service was great, too. Quick and efficient, despite the small space. Overall I'd say this place is worth the wait - although the food didn't blow me away, it's still among the best Japanese I've had in the city so far. Plus I found their options to be super unique. I'm definitely going to brave the lineup again; there are so many other things I'm dying to try!Great Japanese food. Make sure you go a bit earlier as there's always a queue. We waited for 15-20 minutes on the latest visit but you could see the turn around time inside the restaurant was quick and the service was ON it with the many staff working there. We ordered the aubergine starter, chicken gyozas, pork kebabs and tofu kimchi salad, which were all delicious. When we finished these, we were promptly served our main courses - a Korean pork bulgogi-like dish called Buta-Don, a bibimbap with the massive beef rib and a Vegetable Bowl. All were great and well made, well balanced dishes.I would call this Japanese fusion. No sushi is served here. Service was quick. Not the place to go for a long chatty meal.Everything you've heard is true. We came here twice in four days because we couldn't get this food out of our MINDS. Cons: The wait and squished eating experience.Pros: THE. FOOD. Just order everything.Not my first visit, but it had been a while (2011 as I backtrack my pictures!).We basically ordered whatever the waitress suggested.Conclusion? The food was divine, well thought-out with intricate flavours and textures. However sauces do repeat themselves and you fell pressured to order fast and to eat fast; all to ensure their tremendous turnover. Food is a 8.5/10 but the experience as a whole would be more a 7/10 (i.e.: good place for a quick bite on a day you don't want to cook, bad choice for a 'wine and dine' kinda night).This was my first meal in Montréal and I was glad I came here. My friend and I came here after wandering down the street. Because there was a line, we thought that this is definitely a place to go! After waiting for a while, we were seated by the bar so we got to see chefs making every order. Since we didn't eat anything since the night before, we ordered a lot of food. We got mackerel, okonomiyaki, grilled squid, and a chicken burger. We were very happy with the dishes. The mackerel tasted a bit fishy though. Anywho, I'd definitely come back here agin when I'm craving Japanese food and when I'm in the area.This place is part of my top 5 places to go in Montreal! (Visit my page to read my other top 5 reviews!)Kazu has it all - Creativity, taste and atmosphere. I love coming here since they have daily specials that are always surprisingly good. I usually get the Tuna Salmon Bowl, which is absolutely delicious. The texture of the salad mixed with the soft sushi rice and fresh tuna is just perfection at its finest. The portions are quite generous, so be careful of how much you order! Their earl grey ice cream is just a taste of heaven. This is one of the places I miss the most!Trust me when I say this is the place to go for all you 'food instagrammers'. The presentation is out of this world and some of the finest I have seen. What is amazing is that the taste is just as good! Very highly recommended and must go place if you are ever in Montreal.Warning there may be a long lineup, but definitely worth it!Everytime I go by Kazu, I always see a long line up that starts within the restaurant and all the way outside. The line up is there for a good reason. Everything on their menu is so great that it is definitely worth waiting! Although the restaurant is very small, all the servers are quick, very friendly, and organized. I'm surprised at how organized the entire restaurant is despite being a very small restaurant! The food is incredible, classic authentic Japanese & Asian cuisines are available with a fusion twist that fits almost everyone's tastebuds. If you sit at the bar, you're able to see all the chefs at work at their open kitchen which is incredibly cool. I always want to go back to Kazu but I'm not a fan of waiting in line.This is probably one of the few places in Montreal that serves decent Japanese food. While the food and ambiance is good, the wait time and pricing for the food...not so great! Waiting could take up to at least 45 minutes if you are planning to dine in the afternoon. The food here is pretty overpriced considering that each meal is at least $10-17. I would only go here on a special occasion and indulge in lovely Japanese food.Hole in the wall type Japanese BBQ joint, this place is legit. The wait is well worth it. Start with the chicken tortilla then go for the dumplings. The shrimp burger is also delicious. Kazu, the man in the yellow t-shirt does it right.I was actually excited to try this place out as I've seen the kind of monstrous lineup this place can have. Kazu is really small and the tables are tight. The staff were really friendly and you can occasionally hear them yell "thank you" to customers in Japanese, which is quite amusing. Because there was so much hype I was expecting amazing mouth watering food. Unfortunately for me, most dishes were just about mediocre. My appetizer consisted of pork cheek paste served with tortillas. It was okay but I think it would make a better snack than an appetizer and the presentation was a bit messy. I had beef galbi as my main which is korean BBQ short ribs which was served with plain white rice and salad on top. The beef itself was good and well marinated but the salad was really subpar. The salad was cut into strips and appeared boring to me. Also, the dressing was minimal and nothing special. My friend had the ramen and he told me that it wasn't mind-blowing neither. My favorite dish throughout the course was probably the homemade ice cream with wasabi sauce. The waitress told me that they make their own wasabi and it shows. This green Japanese mustard was smooth and it goes surprisingly well with their homemade vanilla ice cream. I didn't get too much of that kick in the nose that you get from commercial wasabi and the flavors were fresh and fragrant. But overall, Kazu to me was just an ordinary visit. I don't know why there's so much hype about this place. Maybe I have to give Kazu another try during diner to change my mind. I will update this review upon my next visit.Delicious. Nothing was bad. Extremely long line up as they don't take reservations. We were a group of 5 and got there at 6 on a really cold day, we had to wait about 15 minutes. Keep in mind they only serve ramen at lunch if you wanted to try it. We tried the beef rib, grilled octopus, shrimp burger, gyoza,  beeef meatball, 48 hour pork, tuna tartar.I cannot say enough about this place. It is my favorite restaurant in Montreal.Food is great - I recommend the Tuna Salmon Bowl and my boyfriend loves the Salmon Burger. Service is impeccable - the waitstaff are friendly, funny, and fast. I enjoy sitting at the bar and ordering a bottle of sake while watching the food be prepared. I understand that some people may complain about the wait on a Friday or Saturday night (the restaurant is very small), but that is definitely part of the charm. The space itself is quaint, intimate, and charming. Great for a casual date, dining alone, or bringing a friend or two.The salad with raw tuna corn and the crispy noodles is so damn good. Love the staff and everything about this gemNot the traditional Japanese food that you've found every corner. It is well marinated and made. THE salmon and tuna bowl and beef dish are all very fresh and flavorful. And the mackerel was great too! Not a big fan of the ice-cream.When in Montreal, you have to add this place on your must-eat destination. I didn't expect to eat at a Japanese restaurant while in Montreal but all the locals rave about it. I came in Kazu for lunch expecting ramen and sushi on the menu. Yeah, they have that but I wanted to try izakaya dishes for the first time. Yes this place comes with a line like all other popular Montrealian restaurants. I have to admit, the space is tiny, tight and overcrowded. The staff is super friendly and unusually cheerful. The menu is one big mess -handwritten with Post-Its add-ons. The food presentation may look disgusting but the taste was out of this world. I had carpaccio de boeuf which was raw filet in a vinegar base sauce over spring mix salad. It's very tasty and a good starter. I also had the eggplant dip. Yes, the presentation is messy looking but it works for this place. As I look around the restaurant, the sheets of paper covering the entire wall described a more adventurous menu that was not reflected on the so-so lunch menu. If you want a daring and adventurous experience, try coming here for dinner. Order from the wall.I visited here already twice, thanks to everybody in Montreal just LOVING this place. They can't stop talking about it! The burgers were alright. Very very tasty but I wouldn't line up for this one. I would line up for the ramen and the 48-hour pork rice!!!! Both of these are incredibly delicious.Staff is forever friendly, even with the rush and jam-packed space that is Kazu. A great place to be!!! I sat at the bar both times I was here, and the kitchen staff are full of smiles and kindness. Kazu deserves my 5 star!F-bomb phenomenal.Get there when the door opens or risk waiting for a bit. But just know this is a line most would gladly stand in for an hour.Menu is alike what we ate in Japan. Seriously. I've only been able to say this once before.It's a busy spot. If your entire party isn't there, they move on to the next. SORRY NOT SORRY.The salmon Tuna bowl is so light and delicious. there is just the right amount of rice and topped with the salmon and tuna makes it so easy to eat. with lettuce, sweet onions and their crispy nest of crispiness (its like strings of the shrimp chips). I would be able to eat this all the time because its so light and flavourful. The sauces in this dish is tangy and solid, just very good. Ramen: The original Ramen satisfies any ramen craving. The noodles feel like their homemade and the broth is very flavourful. It's thick and comforting. The only critique is I wish they were able to strain the soup making it silky and even better. Because now, the broth is sligh grainy from all the stuff they put in it and the meat and noodles and what not. They also have a curry ramen. Its similar to the original but the brother is different, its heavier and thicker. Too man flavours in your mouth after, making it not as pleasing at the original.Both the eggplant dip and porkcheek dip are delicious! texture is so perfect, not gamey or weird at all. Its served with drizzles of diff sauces on the side and their crispy rice puffs. so every bit you taste the dip but you also get the crunch. Very good appetizer. The beef plate is so good! its literaly just rice, salade and ribs or wtv meat. The meat is literally just so flavourful, its juicy and so tender. When you bite it, it rips off the bone so easily and its still so saucy till the moment you put it in your mouth. Shrimp burger is okay, its not one of the best dishes. I think its lacking in seasoning with the patty itself and the bread to patty ratio is off. The shrimp patty is too large but too thin for the bread.The octopus plate was like a burst of flavours. It just melted in your mouth, it was not chewy at all. Easy to eat and just grilled so perfectly.I wanted to order the tuna belly but they sold out. that happens often. The salmon belly is so tender, feels like butter in your mouth. Literally took a bite and i didnt have to chew. I just closed my mouth and the salmon just melted in my mouth on my tongue. Grilled perfected with a great marinade.Overall, Kazu is very good. It's simple food done right. The sauces are so flavourful, the pairing with salads keeps its light and delicious.

The food was divine, well thought-out with intricate flavours and textures. However sauces do repeat themselves and you fell pressured to order fast and to eat fast; all to ensure their tremendous turnover. Food is a 8.5/10 but the experience as a whole would be more a 7/10 (i.e.: good place for a quick bite on a day you don't want to cook, bad choice for a 'wine and dine' kinda night).This was my first meal in Montréal and I was glad I came here. My friend and I came here after wandering down the street. Because there was a line, we thought that this is definitely a place to go! After waiting for a while, we were seated by the bar so we got to see chefs making every order. Since we didn't eat anything since the night before, we ordered a lot of food. We got mackerel, okonomiyaki, grilled squid, and a chicken burger. We were very happy with the dishes. The mackerel tasted a bit fishy though. Anywho, I'd definitely come back here agin when I'm craving Japanese food and when I'm in the area.This place is part of my top 5 places to go in Montreal! (Visit my page to read my other top 5 reviews!)Kazu has it all - Creativity, taste and atmosphere. I love coming here since they have daily specials that are always surprisingly good. I usually get the Tuna Salmon Bowl, which is absolutely delicious. The texture of the salad mixed with the soft sushi rice and fresh tuna is just perfection at its finest. The portions are quite generous, so be careful of how much you order! Their earl grey ice cream is just a taste of heaven. This is one of the places I miss the most!Trust me when I say this is the place to go for all you 'food instagrammers'. The presentation is out of this world and some of the finest I have seen. What is amazing is that the taste is just as good! Very highly recommended and must go place if you are ever in Montreal.Warning there may be a long lineup, but definitely worth it!Everytime I go by Kazu, I always see a long line up that starts within the restaurant and all the way outside. The line up is there for a good reason. Everything on their menu is so great that it is definitely worth waiting! Although the restaurant is very small, all the servers are quick, very friendly, and organized. I'm surprised at how organized the entire restaurant is despite being a very small restaurant! The food is incredible, classic authentic Japanese & Asian cuisines are available with a fusion twist that fits almost everyone's tastebuds. If you sit at the bar, you're able to see all the chefs at work at their open kitchen which is incredibly cool. I always want to go back to Kazu but I'm not a fan of waiting in line.This is probably one of the few places in Montreal that serves decent Japanese food. While the food and ambiance is good, the wait time and pricing for the food...not so great! Waiting could take up to at least 45 minutes if you are planning to dine in the afternoon. The food here is pretty overpriced considering that each meal is at least $10-17. I would only go here on a special occasion and indulge in lovely Japanese food.Hole in the wall type Japanese BBQ joint, this place is legit. The wait is well worth it. Start with the chicken tortilla then go for the dumplings. The shrimp burger is also delicious. Kazu, the man in the yellow t-shirt does it right.I was actually excited to try this place out as I've seen the kind of monstrous lineup this place can have. Kazu is really small and the tables are tight. The staff were really friendly and you can occasionally hear them yell "thank you" to customers in Japanese, which is quite amusing. Because there was so much hype I was expecting amazing mouth watering food. Unfortunately for me, most dishes were just about mediocre. My appetizer consisted of pork cheek paste served with tortillas. It was okay but I think it would make a better snack than an appetizer and the presentation was a bit messy. I had beef galbi as my main which is korean BBQ short ribs which was served with plain white rice and salad on top. The beef itself was good and well marinated but the salad was really subpar. The salad was cut into strips and appeared boring to me. Also, the dressing was minimal and nothing special. My friend had the ramen and he told me that it wasn't mind-blowing neither. My favorite dish throughout the course was probably the homemade ice cream with wasabi sauce. The waitress told me that they make their own wasabi and it shows. This green Japanese mustard was smooth and it goes surprisingly well with their homemade vanilla ice cream. I didn't get too much of that kick in the nose that you get from commercial wasabi and the flavors were fresh and fragrant. But overall, Kazu to me was just an ordinary visit. I don't know why there's so much hype about this place. Maybe I have to give Kazu another try during diner to change my mind. I will update this review upon my next visit.Delicious. Nothing was bad. Extremely long line up as they don't take reservations. We were a group of 5 and got there at 6 on a really cold day, we had to wait about 15 minutes. Keep in mind they only serve ramen at lunch if you wanted to try it. We tried the beef rib, grilled octopus, shrimp burger, gyoza,  beeef meatball, 48 hour pork, tuna tartar.I cannot say enough about this place. It is my favorite restaurant in Montreal.Food is great - I recommend the Tuna Salmon Bowl and my boyfriend loves the Salmon Burger. Service is impeccable - the waitstaff are friendly, funny, and fast. I enjoy sitting at the bar and ordering a bottle of sake while watching the food be prepared. I understand that some people may complain about the wait on a Friday or Saturday night (the restaurant is very small), but that is definitely part of the charm. The space itself is quaint, intimate, and charming. Great for a casual date, dining alone, or bringing a friend or two.The salad with raw tuna corn and the crispy noodles is so damn good. Love the staff and everything about this gemNot the traditional Japanese food that you've found every corner. It is well marinated and made. THE salmon and tuna bowl and beef dish are all very fresh and flavorful. And the mackerel was great too! Not a big fan of the ice-cream.When in Montreal, you have to add this place on your must-eat destination. I didn't expect to eat at a Japanese restaurant while in Montreal but all the locals rave about it. I came in Kazu for lunch expecting ramen and sushi on the menu. Yeah, they have that but I wanted to try izakaya dishes for the first time. Yes this place comes with a line like all other popular Montrealian restaurants. I have to admit, the space is tiny, tight and overcrowded. The staff is super friendly and unusually cheerful. The menu is one big mess -handwritten with Post-Its add-ons. The food presentation may look disgusting but the taste was out of this world. I had carpaccio de boeuf which was raw filet in a vinegar base sauce over spring mix salad. It's very tasty and a good starter. I also had the eggplant dip. Yes, the presentation is messy looking but it works for this place. As I look around the restaurant, the sheets of paper covering the entire wall described a more adventurous menu that was not reflected on the so-so lunch menu. If you want a daring and adventurous experience, try coming here for dinner. Order from the wall.I visited here already twice, thanks to everybody in Montreal just LOVING this place. They can't stop talking about it! The burgers were alright. Very very tasty but I wouldn't line up for this one. I would line up for the ramen and the 48-hour pork rice!!!! Both of these are incredibly delicious.Staff is forever friendly, even with the rush and jam-packed space that is Kazu. A great place to be!!! I sat at the bar both times I was here, and the kitchen staff are full of smiles and kindness. Kazu deserves my 5 star!F-bomb phenomenal.Get there when the door opens or risk waiting for a bit. But just know this is a line most would gladly stand in for an hour.Menu is alike what we ate in Japan. Seriously. I've only been able to say this once before.It's a busy spot. If your entire party isn't there, they move on to the next. SORRY NOT SORRY.The salmon Tuna bowl is so light and delicious. there is just the right amount of rice and topped with the salmon and tuna makes it so easy to eat. with lettuce, sweet onions and their crispy nest of crispiness (its like strings of the shrimp chips). I would be able to eat this all the time because its so light and flavourful. The sauces in this dish is tangy and solid, just very good. Ramen: The original Ramen satisfies any ramen craving. The noodles feel like their homemade and the broth is very flavourful. It's thick and comforting. The only critique is I wish they were able to strain the soup making it silky and even better. Because now, the broth is sligh grainy from all the stuff they put in it and the meat and noodles and what not. They also have a curry ramen. Its similar to the original but the brother is different, its heavier and thicker. Too man flavours in your mouth after, making it not as pleasing at the original.Both the eggplant dip and porkcheek dip are delicious! texture is so perfect, not gamey or weird at all. Its served with drizzles of diff sauces on the side and their crispy rice puffs. so every bit you taste the dip but you also get the crunch. Very good appetizer. The beef plate is so good! its literaly just rice, salade and ribs or wtv meat. The meat is literally just so flavourful, its juicy and so tender. When you bite it, it rips off the bone so easily and its still so saucy till the moment you put it in your mouth. Shrimp burger is okay, its not one of the best dishes. I think its lacking in seasoning with the patty itself and the bread to patty ratio is off. The shrimp patty is too large but too thin for the bread.The octopus plate was like a burst of flavours. It just melted in your mouth, it was not chewy at all. Easy to eat and just grilled so perfectly.I wanted to order the tuna belly but they sold out. that happens often. The salmon belly is so tender, feels like butter in your mouth. Literally took a bite and i didnt have to chew. I just closed my mouth and the salmon just melted in my mouth on my tongue. Grilled perfected with a great marinade.Overall, Kazu is very good. It's simple food done right. The sauces are so flavourful, the pairing with salads keeps its light and delicious. I would recommend Kazu to everyone and it is definitely worth the wait no matter how long the line!Absolutely, without a doubt, the best Japanese food I've ever had the honor of eating. It is truly a blessing to have been able to eat here twice. My boyfriend and I visited Montreal for four days and two of them were spent at Kazu. On one of the days, my poor, cold, boyfriend had a craving for ramen. Thanks to his craving and Yelp, we were able to find Kazu! When we got there, there was a line to get inside. It was so cold but we stuck it out and made it in! This place is small. There's maybe 6 counter seats and 5 tables inside that can seat 2-4 people each.We had the ramen (which btw is the absolute BEST ramen I've ever had) and the beef rib bowl the first day we went and the second day we had the ramen and tuna/salmon salad. The second day we went we were driving five hours back home. We lamented not having any accessibility to Kazu anymore so we ordered a beef rib bowl to go. They gave us two huge ribs! It was awesome! I don't know how to describe the amazing flavor in all their dishes. Their food puts me at a loss for words. At best, all I can say is it is amazing and savory and delicious. Their food tastes like edible love. My boyfriend and I still talk about how amazing Kazu is and if it's feasible to drive five hours and cross the US/Canada border just to eat there. Seriously, it's that good.If you are blessed enough to live in Montreal and haven't tried Kazu yet, go! You are SO lucky! I envy you! And if you're in Montreal visiting and trying to decide where's a good place to eat, I've decided for you, it's Kazu! GO!Opens at 12 for lunch so try to arrive 15mins early to make sure to have a seat.Tiny little japanesse restaurant with super good good. Had the tuna and salmon rice bowl and it was delicious.The restaurant is very small and tables are really close to each other...you are seated extremely closely to your neighbor table....If you mind that then it's not the place for you. If you are into great food and friendly service than make sure to check it out.Okay, let me start off by saying I hyped this place way too much in my head. I read the reviews, I waited the hour in line, I anticipated coming here for about a year... I was expecting, like, the holy grail of Japanese food. Beyond that, even. I was expecting to taste flavours that don't even exist yet. And I was a little disappointed, but only because I had built Kazu up to an unattainable standard. I tried the shrimp burger and the 48 hour beef bowl; both were really, really good. I liked the shrimp burger a little more (believe the hype on this one, guys), but the 48 hour beef was really delicious. Super flavourful and fresh. And service was great, too. Quick and efficient, despite the small space. Overall I'd say this place is worth the wait - although the food didn't blow me away, it's still among the best Japanese I've had in the city so far. Plus I found their options to be super unique. I'm definitely going to brave the lineup again; there are so many other things I'm dying to try!Great Japanese food. Make sure you go a bit earlier as there's always a queue. We waited for 15-20 minutes on the latest visit but you could see the turn around time inside the restaurant was quick and the service was ON it with the many staff working there. We ordered the aubergine starter, chicken gyozas, pork kebabs and tofu kimchi salad, which were all delicious. When we finished these, we were promptly served our main courses - a Korean pork bulgogi-like dish called Buta-Don, a bibimbap with the massive beef rib and a Vegetable Bowl. All were great and well made, well balanced dishes.I would call this Japanese fusion. No sushi is served here. Service was quick. Not the place to go for a long chatty meal.Everything you've heard is true. We came here twice in four days because we couldn't get this food out of our MINDS. Cons: The wait and squished eating experience.Pros: THE. FOOD. Just order everything.Not my first visit, but it had been a while (2011 as I backtrack my pictures!).We basically ordered whatever the waitress suggested.Conclusion?

I didn't get too much of that kick in the nose that you get from commercial wasabi and the flavors were fresh and fragrant. But overall, Kazu to me was just an ordinary visit. I don't know why there's so much hype about this place. Maybe I have to give Kazu another try during diner to change my mind. I will update this review upon my next visit.Delicious. Nothing was bad. Extremely long line up as they don't take reservations. We were a group of 5 and got there at 6 on a really cold day, we had to wait about 15 minutes. Keep in mind they only serve ramen at lunch if you wanted to try it. We tried the beef rib, grilled octopus, shrimp burger, gyoza,  beeef meatball, 48 hour pork, tuna tartar.I cannot say enough about this place. It is my favorite restaurant in Montreal.Food is great - I recommend the Tuna Salmon Bowl and my boyfriend loves the Salmon Burger. Service is impeccable - the waitstaff are friendly, funny, and fast. I enjoy sitting at the bar and ordering a bottle of sake while watching the food be prepared. I understand that some people may complain about the wait on a Friday or Saturday night (the restaurant is very small), but that is definitely part of the charm. The space itself is quaint, intimate, and charming. Great for a casual date, dining alone, or bringing a friend or two.The salad with raw tuna corn and the crispy noodles is so damn good. Love the staff and everything about this gemNot the traditional Japanese food that you've found every corner. It is well marinated and made. THE salmon and tuna bowl and beef dish are all very fresh and flavorful. And the mackerel was great too! Not a big fan of the ice-cream.When in Montreal, you have to add this place on your must-eat destination. I didn't expect to eat at a Japanese restaurant while in Montreal but all the locals rave about it. I came in Kazu for lunch expecting ramen and sushi on the menu. Yeah, they have that but I wanted to try izakaya dishes for the first time. Yes this place comes with a line like all other popular Montrealian restaurants. I have to admit, the space is tiny, tight and overcrowded. The staff is super friendly and unusually cheerful. The menu is one big mess -handwritten with Post-Its add-ons. The food presentation may look disgusting but the taste was out of this world. I had carpaccio de boeuf which was raw filet in a vinegar base sauce over spring mix salad. It's very tasty and a good starter. I also had the eggplant dip. Yes, the presentation is messy looking but it works for this place. As I look around the restaurant, the sheets of paper covering the entire wall described a more adventurous menu that was not reflected on the so-so lunch menu. If you want a daring and adventurous experience, try coming here for dinner. Order from the wall.I visited here already twice, thanks to everybody in Montreal just LOVING this place. They can't stop talking about it! The burgers were alright. Very very tasty but I wouldn't line up for this one. I would line up for the ramen and the 48-hour pork rice!!!! Both of these are incredibly delicious.Staff is forever friendly, even with the rush and jam-packed space that is Kazu. A great place to be!!! I sat at the bar both times I was here, and the kitchen staff are full of smiles and kindness. Kazu deserves my 5 star!F-bomb phenomenal.Get there when the door opens or risk waiting for a bit. But just know this is a line most would gladly stand in for an hour.Menu is alike what we ate in Japan. Seriously. I've only been able to say this once before.It's a busy spot. If your entire party isn't there, they move on to the next. SORRY NOT SORRY.The salmon Tuna bowl is so light and delicious. there is just the right amount of rice and topped with the salmon and tuna makes it so easy to eat. with lettuce, sweet onions and their crispy nest of crispiness (its like strings of the shrimp chips). I would be able to eat this all the time because its so light and flavourful. The sauces in this dish is tangy and solid, just very good. Ramen: The original Ramen satisfies any ramen craving. The noodles feel like their homemade and the broth is very flavourful. It's thick and comforting. The only critique is I wish they were able to strain the soup making it silky and even better. Because now, the broth is sligh grainy from all the stuff they put in it and the meat and noodles and what not. They also have a curry ramen. Its similar to the original but the brother is different, its heavier and thicker. Too man flavours in your mouth after, making it not as pleasing at the original.Both the eggplant dip and porkcheek dip are delicious! texture is so perfect, not gamey or weird at all. Its served with drizzles of diff sauces on the side and their crispy rice puffs. so every bit you taste the dip but you also get the crunch. Very good appetizer. The beef plate is so good! its literaly just rice, salade and ribs or wtv meat. The meat is literally just so flavourful, its juicy and so tender. When you bite it, it rips off the bone so easily and its still so saucy till the moment you put it in your mouth. Shrimp burger is okay, its not one of the best dishes. I think its lacking in seasoning with the patty itself and the bread to patty ratio is off. The shrimp patty is too large but too thin for the bread.The octopus plate was like a burst of flavours. It just melted in your mouth, it was not chewy at all. Easy to eat and just grilled so perfectly.I wanted to order the tuna belly but they sold out. that happens often. The salmon belly is so tender, feels like butter in your mouth. Literally took a bite and i didnt have to chew. I just closed my mouth and the salmon just melted in my mouth on my tongue. Grilled perfected with a great marinade.Overall, Kazu is very good. It's simple food done right. The sauces are so flavourful, the pairing with salads keeps its light and delicious. I would recommend Kazu to everyone and it is definitely worth the wait no matter how long the line!Absolutely, without a doubt, the best Japanese food I've ever had the honor of eating. It is truly a blessing to have been able to eat here twice. My boyfriend and I visited Montreal for four days and two of them were spent at Kazu. On one of the days, my poor, cold, boyfriend had a craving for ramen. Thanks to his craving and Yelp, we were able to find Kazu! When we got there, there was a line to get inside. It was so cold but we stuck it out and made it in! This place is small. There's maybe 6 counter seats and 5 tables inside that can seat 2-4 people each.We had the ramen (which btw is the absolute BEST ramen I've ever had) and the beef rib bowl the first day we went and the second day we had the ramen and tuna/salmon salad. The second day we went we were driving five hours back home. We lamented not having any accessibility to Kazu anymore so we ordered a beef rib bowl to go. They gave us two huge ribs! It was awesome! I don't know how to describe the amazing flavor in all their dishes. Their food puts me at a loss for words. At best, all I can say is it is amazing and savory and delicious. Their food tastes like edible love. My boyfriend and I still talk about how amazing Kazu is and if it's feasible to drive five hours and cross the US/Canada border just to eat there. Seriously, it's that good.If you are blessed enough to live in Montreal and haven't tried Kazu yet, go! You are SO lucky! I envy you! And if you're in Montreal visiting and trying to decide where's a good place to eat, I've decided for you, it's Kazu! GO!Opens at 12 for lunch so try to arrive 15mins early to make sure to have a seat.Tiny little japanesse restaurant with super good good. Had the tuna and salmon rice bowl and it was delicious.The restaurant is very small and tables are really close to each other...you are seated extremely closely to your neighbor table....If you mind that then it's not the place for you. If you are into great food and friendly service than make sure to check it out.Okay, let me start off by saying I hyped this place way too much in my head. I read the reviews, I waited the hour in line, I anticipated coming here for about a year... I was expecting, like, the holy grail of Japanese food. Beyond that, even. I was expecting to taste flavours that don't even exist yet. And I was a little disappointed, but only because I had built Kazu up to an unattainable standard. I tried the shrimp burger and the 48 hour beef bowl; both were really, really good. I liked the shrimp burger a little more (believe the hype on this one, guys), but the 48 hour beef was really delicious. Super flavourful and fresh. And service was great, too. Quick and efficient, despite the small space. Overall I'd say this place is worth the wait - although the food didn't blow me away, it's still among the best Japanese I've had in the city so far. Plus I found their options to be super unique. I'm definitely going to brave the lineup again; there are so many other things I'm dying to try!Great Japanese food. Make sure you go a bit earlier as there's always a queue. We waited for 15-20 minutes on the latest visit but you could see the turn around time inside the restaurant was quick and the service was ON it with the many staff working there. We ordered the aubergine starter, chicken gyozas, pork kebabs and tofu kimchi salad, which were all delicious. When we finished these, we were promptly served our main courses - a Korean pork bulgogi-like dish called Buta-Don, a bibimbap with the massive beef rib and a Vegetable Bowl. All were great and well made, well balanced dishes.I would call this Japanese fusion. No sushi is served here. Service was quick. Not the place to go for a long chatty meal.Everything you've heard is true. We came here twice in four days because we couldn't get this food out of our MINDS. Cons: The wait and squished eating experience.Pros: THE. FOOD. Just order everything.Not my first visit, but it had been a while (2011 as I backtrack my pictures!).We basically ordered whatever the waitress suggested.Conclusion? The food was divine, well thought-out with intricate flavours and textures. However sauces do repeat themselves and you fell pressured to order fast and to eat fast; all to ensure their tremendous turnover. Food is a 8.5/10 but the experience as a whole would be more a 7/10 (i.e.: good place for a quick bite on a day you don't want to cook, bad choice for a 'wine and dine' kinda night).This was my first meal in Montréal and I was glad I came here. My friend and I came here after wandering down the street. Because there was a line, we thought that this is definitely a place to go! After waiting for a while, we were seated by the bar so we got to see chefs making every order. Since we didn't eat anything since the night before, we ordered a lot of food. We got mackerel, okonomiyaki, grilled squid, and a chicken burger. We were very happy with the dishes. The mackerel tasted a bit fishy though. Anywho, I'd definitely come back here agin when I'm craving Japanese food and when I'm in the area.This place is part of my top 5 places to go in Montreal! (Visit my page to read my other top 5 reviews!)Kazu has it all - Creativity, taste and atmosphere. I love coming here since they have daily specials that are always surprisingly good. I usually get the Tuna Salmon Bowl, which is absolutely delicious. The texture of the salad mixed with the soft sushi rice and fresh tuna is just perfection at its finest. The portions are quite generous, so be careful of how much you order! Their earl grey ice cream is just a taste of heaven. This is one of the places I miss the most!Trust me when I say this is the place to go for all you 'food instagrammers'. The presentation is out of this world and some of the finest I have seen. What is amazing is that the taste is just as good! Very highly recommended and must go place if you are ever in Montreal.Warning there may be a long lineup, but definitely worth it!Everytime I go by Kazu, I always see a long line up that starts within the restaurant and all the way outside. The line up is there for a good reason. Everything on their menu is so great that it is definitely worth waiting! Although the restaurant is very small, all the servers are quick, very friendly, and organized. I'm surprised at how organized the entire restaurant is despite being a very small restaurant! The food is incredible, classic authentic Japanese & Asian cuisines are available with a fusion twist that fits almost everyone's tastebuds. If you sit at the bar, you're able to see all the chefs at work at their open kitchen which is incredibly cool. I always want to go back to Kazu but I'm not a fan of waiting in line.This is probably one of the few places in Montreal that serves decent Japanese food. While the food and ambiance is good, the wait time and pricing for the food...not so great! Waiting could take up to at least 45 minutes if you are planning to dine in the afternoon. The food here is pretty overpriced considering that each meal is at least $10-17. I would only go here on a special occasion and indulge in lovely Japanese food.Hole in the wall type Japanese BBQ joint, this place is legit. The wait is well worth it. Start with the chicken tortilla then go for the dumplings. The shrimp burger is also delicious. Kazu, the man in the yellow t-shirt does it right.I was actually excited to try this place out as I've seen the kind of monstrous lineup this place can have. Kazu is really small and the tables are tight. The staff were really friendly and you can occasionally hear them yell "thank you" to customers in Japanese, which is quite amusing. Because there was so much hype I was expecting amazing mouth watering food. Unfortunately for me, most dishes were just about mediocre. My appetizer consisted of pork cheek paste served with tortillas. It was okay but I think it would make a better snack than an appetizer and the presentation was a bit messy. I had beef galbi as my main which is korean BBQ short ribs which was served with plain white rice and salad on top. The beef itself was good and well marinated but the salad was really subpar. The salad was cut into strips and appeared boring to me. Also, the dressing was minimal and nothing special. My friend had the ramen and he told me that it wasn't mind-blowing neither. My favorite dish throughout the course was probably the homemade ice cream with wasabi sauce. The waitress told me that they make their own wasabi and it shows. This green Japanese mustard was smooth and it goes surprisingly well with their homemade vanilla ice cream. I didn't get too much of that kick in the nose that you get from commercial wasabi and the flavors were fresh and fragrant. But overall, Kazu to me was just an ordinary visit.

Too man flavours in your mouth after, making it not as pleasing at the original.Both the eggplant dip and porkcheek dip are delicious! texture is so perfect, not gamey or weird at all. Its served with drizzles of diff sauces on the side and their crispy rice puffs. so every bit you taste the dip but you also get the crunch. Very good appetizer. The beef plate is so good! its literaly just rice, salade and ribs or wtv meat. The meat is literally just so flavourful, its juicy and so tender. When you bite it, it rips off the bone so easily and its still so saucy till the moment you put it in your mouth. Shrimp burger is okay, its not one of the best dishes. I think its lacking in seasoning with the patty itself and the bread to patty ratio is off. The shrimp patty is too large but too thin for the bread.The octopus plate was like a burst of flavours. It just melted in your mouth, it was not chewy at all. Easy to eat and just grilled so perfectly.I wanted to order the tuna belly but they sold out. that happens often. The salmon belly is so tender, feels like butter in your mouth. Literally took a bite and i didnt have to chew. I just closed my mouth and the salmon just melted in my mouth on my tongue. Grilled perfected with a great marinade.Overall, Kazu is very good. It's simple food done right. The sauces are so flavourful, the pairing with salads keeps its light and delicious. I would recommend Kazu to everyone and it is definitely worth the wait no matter how long the line!Absolutely, without a doubt, the best Japanese food I've ever had the honor of eating. It is truly a blessing to have been able to eat here twice. My boyfriend and I visited Montreal for four days and two of them were spent at Kazu. On one of the days, my poor, cold, boyfriend had a craving for ramen. Thanks to his craving and Yelp, we were able to find Kazu! When we got there, there was a line to get inside. It was so cold but we stuck it out and made it in! This place is small. There's maybe 6 counter seats and 5 tables inside that can seat 2-4 people each.We had the ramen (which btw is the absolute BEST ramen I've ever had) and the beef rib bowl the first day we went and the second day we had the ramen and tuna/salmon salad. The second day we went we were driving five hours back home. We lamented not having any accessibility to Kazu anymore so we ordered a beef rib bowl to go. They gave us two huge ribs! It was awesome! I don't know how to describe the amazing flavor in all their dishes. Their food puts me at a loss for words. At best, all I can say is it is amazing and savory and delicious. Their food tastes like edible love. My boyfriend and I still talk about how amazing Kazu is and if it's feasible to drive five hours and cross the US/Canada border just to eat there. Seriously, it's that good.If you are blessed enough to live in Montreal and haven't tried Kazu yet, go! You are SO lucky! I envy you! And if you're in Montreal visiting and trying to decide where's a good place to eat, I've decided for you, it's Kazu! GO!Opens at 12 for lunch so try to arrive 15mins early to make sure to have a seat.Tiny little japanesse restaurant with super good good. Had the tuna and salmon rice bowl and it was delicious.The restaurant is very small and tables are really close to each other...you are seated extremely closely to your neighbor table....If you mind that then it's not the place for you. If you are into great food and friendly service than make sure to check it out.Okay, let me start off by saying I hyped this place way too much in my head. I read the reviews, I waited the hour in line, I anticipated coming here for about a year... I was expecting, like, the holy grail of Japanese food. Beyond that, even. I was expecting to taste flavours that don't even exist yet. And I was a little disappointed, but only because I had built Kazu up to an unattainable standard. I tried the shrimp burger and the 48 hour beef bowl; both were really, really good. I liked the shrimp burger a little more (believe the hype on this one, guys), but the 48 hour beef was really delicious. Super flavourful and fresh. And service was great, too. Quick and efficient, despite the small space. Overall I'd say this place is worth the wait - although the food didn't blow me away, it's still among the best Japanese I've had in the city so far. Plus I found their options to be super unique. I'm definitely going to brave the lineup again; there are so many other things I'm dying to try!Great Japanese food. Make sure you go a bit earlier as there's always a queue. We waited for 15-20 minutes on the latest visit but you could see the turn around time inside the restaurant was quick and the service was ON it with the many staff working there. We ordered the aubergine starter, chicken gyozas, pork kebabs and tofu kimchi salad, which were all delicious. When we finished these, we were promptly served our main courses - a Korean pork bulgogi-like dish called Buta-Don, a bibimbap with the massive beef rib and a Vegetable Bowl. All were great and well made, well balanced dishes.I would call this Japanese fusion. No sushi is served here. Service was quick. Not the place to go for a long chatty meal.Everything you've heard is true. We came here twice in four days because we couldn't get this food out of our MINDS. Cons: The wait and squished eating experience.Pros: THE. FOOD. Just order everything.Not my first visit, but it had been a while (2011 as I backtrack my pictures!).We basically ordered whatever the waitress suggested.Conclusion? The food was divine, well thought-out with intricate flavours and textures. However sauces do repeat themselves and you fell pressured to order fast and to eat fast; all to ensure their tremendous turnover. Food is a 8.5/10 but the experience as a whole would be more a 7/10 (i.e.: good place for a quick bite on a day you don't want to cook, bad choice for a 'wine and dine' kinda night).This was my first meal in Montréal and I was glad I came here. My friend and I came here after wandering down the street. Because there was a line, we thought that this is definitely a place to go! After waiting for a while, we were seated by the bar so we got to see chefs making every order. Since we didn't eat anything since the night before, we ordered a lot of food. We got mackerel, okonomiyaki, grilled squid, and a chicken burger. We were very happy with the dishes. The mackerel tasted a bit fishy though. Anywho, I'd definitely come back here agin when I'm craving Japanese food and when I'm in the area.This place is part of my top 5 places to go in Montreal! (Visit my page to read my other top 5 reviews!)Kazu has it all - Creativity, taste and atmosphere. I love coming here since they have daily specials that are always surprisingly good. I usually get the Tuna Salmon Bowl, which is absolutely delicious. The texture of the salad mixed with the soft sushi rice and fresh tuna is just perfection at its finest. The portions are quite generous, so be careful of how much you order! Their earl grey ice cream is just a taste of heaven. This is one of the places I miss the most!Trust me when I say this is the place to go for all you 'food instagrammers'. The presentation is out of this world and some of the finest I have seen. What is amazing is that the taste is just as good! Very highly recommended and must go place if you are ever in Montreal.Warning there may be a long lineup, but definitely worth it!Everytime I go by Kazu, I always see a long line up that starts within the restaurant and all the way outside. The line up is there for a good reason. Everything on their menu is so great that it is definitely worth waiting! Although the restaurant is very small, all the servers are quick, very friendly, and organized. I'm surprised at how organized the entire restaurant is despite being a very small restaurant! The food is incredible, classic authentic Japanese & Asian cuisines are available with a fusion twist that fits almost everyone's tastebuds. If you sit at the bar, you're able to see all the chefs at work at their open kitchen which is incredibly cool. I always want to go back to Kazu but I'm not a fan of waiting in line.This is probably one of the few places in Montreal that serves decent Japanese food. While the food and ambiance is good, the wait time and pricing for the food...not so great! Waiting could take up to at least 45 minutes if you are planning to dine in the afternoon. The food here is pretty overpriced considering that each meal is at least $10-17. I would only go here on a special occasion and indulge in lovely Japanese food.Hole in the wall type Japanese BBQ joint, this place is legit. The wait is well worth it. Start with the chicken tortilla then go for the dumplings. The shrimp burger is also delicious. Kazu, the man in the yellow t-shirt does it right.I was actually excited to try this place out as I've seen the kind of monstrous lineup this place can have. Kazu is really small and the tables are tight. The staff were really friendly and you can occasionally hear them yell "thank you" to customers in Japanese, which is quite amusing. Because there was so much hype I was expecting amazing mouth watering food. Unfortunately for me, most dishes were just about mediocre. My appetizer consisted of pork cheek paste served with tortillas. It was okay but I think it would make a better snack than an appetizer and the presentation was a bit messy. I had beef galbi as my main which is korean BBQ short ribs which was served with plain white rice and salad on top. The beef itself was good and well marinated but the salad was really subpar. The salad was cut into strips and appeared boring to me. Also, the dressing was minimal and nothing special. My friend had the ramen and he told me that it wasn't mind-blowing neither. My favorite dish throughout the course was probably the homemade ice cream with wasabi sauce. The waitress told me that they make their own wasabi and it shows. This green Japanese mustard was smooth and it goes surprisingly well with their homemade vanilla ice cream. I didn't get too much of that kick in the nose that you get from commercial wasabi and the flavors were fresh and fragrant. But overall, Kazu to me was just an ordinary visit. I don't know why there's so much hype about this place. Maybe I have to give Kazu another try during diner to change my mind. I will update this review upon my next visit.Delicious. Nothing was bad. Extremely long line up as they don't take reservations. We were a group of 5 and got there at 6 on a really cold day, we had to wait about 15 minutes. Keep in mind they only serve ramen at lunch if you wanted to try it. We tried the beef rib, grilled octopus, shrimp burger, gyoza,  beeef meatball, 48 hour pork, tuna tartar.I cannot say enough about this place. It is my favorite restaurant in Montreal.Food is great - I recommend the Tuna Salmon Bowl and my boyfriend loves the Salmon Burger. Service is impeccable - the waitstaff are friendly, funny, and fast. I enjoy sitting at the bar and ordering a bottle of sake while watching the food be prepared. I understand that some people may complain about the wait on a Friday or Saturday night (the restaurant is very small), but that is definitely part of the charm. The space itself is quaint, intimate, and charming. Great for a casual date, dining alone, or bringing a friend or two.The salad with raw tuna corn and the crispy noodles is so damn good. Love the staff and everything about this gemNot the traditional Japanese food that you've found every corner. It is well marinated and made. THE salmon and tuna bowl and beef dish are all very fresh and flavorful. And the mackerel was great too! Not a big fan of the ice-cream.When in Montreal, you have to add this place on your must-eat destination. I didn't expect to eat at a Japanese restaurant while in Montreal but all the locals rave about it. I came in Kazu for lunch expecting ramen and sushi on the menu. Yeah, they have that but I wanted to try izakaya dishes for the first time. Yes this place comes with a line like all other popular Montrealian restaurants. I have to admit, the space is tiny, tight and overcrowded. The staff is super friendly and unusually cheerful. The menu is one big mess -handwritten with Post-Its add-ons. The food presentation may look disgusting but the taste was out of this world. I had carpaccio de boeuf which was raw filet in a vinegar base sauce over spring mix salad. It's very tasty and a good starter. I also had the eggplant dip. Yes, the presentation is messy looking but it works for this place. As I look around the restaurant, the sheets of paper covering the entire wall described a more adventurous menu that was not reflected on the so-so lunch menu. If you want a daring and adventurous experience, try coming here for dinner. Order from the wall.I visited here already twice, thanks to everybody in Montreal just LOVING this place. They can't stop talking about it! The burgers were alright. Very very tasty but I wouldn't line up for this one. I would line up for the ramen and the 48-hour pork rice!!!! Both of these are incredibly delicious.Staff is forever friendly, even with the rush and jam-packed space that is Kazu. A great place to be!!! I sat at the bar both times I was here, and the kitchen staff are full of smiles and kindness. Kazu deserves my 5 star!F-bomb phenomenal.Get there when the door opens or risk waiting for a bit. But just know this is a line most would gladly stand in for an hour.Menu is alike what we ate in Japan. Seriously. I've only been able to say this once before.It's a busy spot. If your entire party isn't there, they move on to the next. SORRY NOT SORRY.The salmon Tuna bowl is so light and delicious. there is just the right amount of rice and topped with the salmon and tuna makes it so easy to eat. with lettuce, sweet onions and their crispy nest of crispiness (its like strings of the shrimp chips). I would be able to eat this all the time because its so light and flavourful. The sauces in this dish is tangy and solid, just very good. Ramen: The original Ramen satisfies any ramen craving. The noodles feel like their homemade and the broth is very flavourful. It's thick and comforting. The only critique is I wish they were able to strain the soup making it silky and even better. Because now, the broth is sligh grainy from all the stuff they put in it and the meat and noodles and what not. They also have a curry ramen. Its similar to the original but the brother is different, its heavier and thicker. Too man flavours in your mouth after, making it not as pleasing at the original.Both the eggplant dip and porkcheek dip are delicious! texture is so perfect, not gamey or weird at all.
